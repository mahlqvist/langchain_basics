# Exploring LangChain ðŸ¦œ 


This is a hands-on repo for learning and experimenting with the core features of **LangChain** ðŸ¦œ.

This is not a production project, more like a sandbox for exploring what LangChain has to offer!

This repo contains small, focused experiments to help me understand how to use LangChain's tools. Key topics explored:

- **LLMs & Chat Models** â€“ working with OpenAI and other language models.
- **Prompt Templates** â€“ structuring reusable, dynamic prompts.
- **Output Parsers** â€“ extracting structured data from language model responses.
- **Document Loaders** - load data from PDFs or URLs into a Document objects.
- **Chains** â€“ connecting multiple steps together into workflows.
- **Text Splitters** â€“ breaking large documents into chunks for processing.
- **Vector Stores** â€“ storing and searching text using embeddings (e.g. FAISS, ChromaDB).
- **Memory** â€“ maintaining conversation history across interactions.
- **Retrieval** â€“ querying external documents with context-aware answers.
- **Agents & Tools** â€“ building autonomous chains that make decisions and call tools.

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv env

source env/bin/activate # on Windows: env\Scripts\activate

# for jupyter notebook
pip install ipykernel

# add your virtual env to Jupyter, replace myenv with the name of your venv
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=env

# if you want interactive html-widgets install ipywidgets
pip install ipywidgets

# install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

Examples on how it might look:

* `examples/chat_model_basic.py` â€“ Chat with a language model.
* `examples/prompt_template_demo.py` â€“ Build prompts dynamically.
* `examples/output_parser_example.py` â€“ Extract structured output.
* `examples/document_loaders.py` â€“ Load documents from a variety of sources.
* `examples/text_splitters.py` â€“ Split text into small, semantically meaningful chunks.
* `examples/embedding_models.py` â€“ Generate vector representations.
* `examples/vectorstore_retrieval.py` â€“ Search documents with semantic meaning.
* `examples/agent_tool_use.py` â€“ Let an agent decide what to do.

I'm building this to understand how LangChain works under the hood and how to use its components in a flexible, modular way. My goal is to master practical tools for building AI-powered apps.
